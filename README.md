# EmbroiderThread
As my skills developed from a beginner to an intermediate sewist, I expanded my sewing hobby to include machine embroidery. When choosing an embroidery design, various aspects need to be taken into account such as: thread colors, weight, size,type, and desired effect amongst many others. As a result, the embroidery thread collection one owns may be extensive. In order to address that issue for myself, I decided to create a Python script to track all my embroidery thread in one place. 

## Description
The EmbroiderThread Python script is meant to run locally on your Terminal. This script allows users to manage machine embroidery thread using CRUD operation: add, edit, delete, and view the embroidery thread collection. By navigating the various menus, users can view & edit the thread SKU, Item #, Name, Type, Length, Brand, and Dupes. 

## Future Development
- User Interface: Implement an interactive GUI to be more user-friendly.
- Integration with SewWise: To incorporate to [SewWise](https://github.com/xocaid/SewWise) --> in order to manage and track sewing projects and threads.
- Thread Support: Expand functionality to include tracking of Sewing Thread and other threads as well
